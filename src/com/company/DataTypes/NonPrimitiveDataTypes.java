//Non-Primitive Data Types:
/*
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
1. Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java.
   Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
2. Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
3. A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
4. A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
5. The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.
You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
