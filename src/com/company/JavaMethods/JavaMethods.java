/*
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

Create a Method
A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method,
followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(),
but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
*/
public class JavaMethods {
     static void myMethod() {
       // code to be executed
    }
}
/*
Example Explained
myMethod() - is the name of the method.
static     - means that the method belongs to the JavaMethods class and not an object of the JavaMethod Class.
void       - means that this method does not have a return value.
